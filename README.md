# Stallions Offense
The implementation of a voice app that interacts with a user on the basis of a sample intent.

## Invocation

### Simplistic
'Greater Boston Stallions Offense' is a mouthful.  Keeping the invocation simple, to just 'Stallions Offense' saves the user time and makes the app feel more accessible--more within reach. This prevents annoyance, and encourages a user to take advantage of the app.    

### Nonspecific
It is conceivable that more custom intents could be added in the future. For this reason, it is better that the invocation represents something less specific than something like 'Stallions Route Tree' for instance.

## Sample Utterances
Given the repetitive nature of the sample utterances, there may be an opportunity to eliminate repetition when certain words are truly interchangeable.
